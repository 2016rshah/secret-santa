##Contributing

Since this is such a simple project and is going to be used by pretty non-technical people, I am trying to make it as easy to use and contribute to. If you're relatively new to open source, this is a great project to start on, especially if you know basic javascript. Let me know if you would like to help or just check out the [Issues](https://github.com/2016rshah/secret-santa/issues) tab.
